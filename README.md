# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be in the P5 HTML Library and simulate the movement of a ball over several planes with varying amounts of friction. Ideally, the project will contain three slanted planes with sliders below, allowing the user to ajust their friction. More friction will obviously result in less velocity with each passing and a final velocity will be recorded as the ball hits the bottom of the screen.

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class to implement gravity
* allow the ball to recognize and collide with the planes
* implement friction into the planes
* implement a slider that modifies friction
* allow the program to detect the velocity of the ball and display it once the ball reaches the bottom
