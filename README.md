# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be in the P5 HTML Library and simulate the movement of a ball over several planes with varying amounts of friction. Ideally, the project will contain three slanted planes with sliders below, allowing the user to ajust their friction. More friction will obviously result in less velocity with each passing and a final velocity will be recorded as the ball hits the bottom of the screen.

## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class to implement gravity
* allow the ball to recognize and collide with the planes
* implement friction into the planes
* implement a slider that modifies friction
* allow the program to detect the velocity of the ball and display it once the ball reaches the bottom

## Final Questions
 
What (if anything â€“ although there is probably at least something) does the user need to know about what your program does?

My program simulates the act of friction on a rolling ball.


What (if anything) does the user need to know to operate your program (keystrokes, et cetera)?

The slider at the bottom is used to modify the percentage of the ball's velocity


How does your program show evidence of your understanding of object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation and inheritance?



What evidence can you provide that your program is human-readable?
For example, where have you used:
descriptive function names
meaningful variable names
comments that describe the intention of a block of code
What is the most important algorithm, or algorithm(s), in your program?
That is, where is the "core idea" of your program?
Explain how this works.
How have you made your program easy to use?
How have you made correct use of source control?
For example, show that you have:
made frequent commits
kept commits "atomic" (i.e.: one accomplishment per commit, rather than a batch of things all committed at once)
descriptive commit messages
You may begin working on responses to these questions prior to Monday's class, but must have your responses to these questions completed by the end of Monday's class.
